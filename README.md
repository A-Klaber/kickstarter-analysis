# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

    The project uses data from a kickstarter website, which was provided for us. We were looking for trends that could create a better success rate of launching play, based on launch dates and funding goals. All files data is located [here](/Kickstarter_Challenge1.xlsx).
    
### Purpose

    This project was to get a better understanding of the tools and charts available in excel. To understand how to remove unnecessary data and only use the selected data from a large amount of information. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    All events have a cycle. Based on launch date, we are trying to find the cycle of best success rate. using the launch date, we compared the data for successful, failed, and canceled theater events. ![This is an image](/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
    

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

    Analyzing the goals and outcomes Based on percentages. Separating them mainly into 5,000 dollar brackets. ![This is an image](/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

   One challenge was getting the right fields in the rows and columns for the pivot chart. it was trial and error to get the correct numbers in the correct sections. Another was the greater and equal signs. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    Based on the data, the best time to launch a campaign would be in summer, May, June, and July. The least successful launch dates would be in the winter, November thru January having lower success rates.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    Based on the data, the highest success rates, are campaigns with a goal of less than 5,000 dollars. The campaigns over 5,000 are relatively equal in percentage of a successful vs failed outcome, with a higher increase in failure when the goals near the 20,000 dollar range and above. The percentage chart is misleading. The chart should be based on the number of attempts as well. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    limitations of this data set as a whole, would be we donâ€™t know if the creator of each event is a company or an individual aka. professional with experience or amateur. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    Possible tables and or graphs would need to include a statistical approach, using the number of attempts along with the percentage of success and failures to give a better picture.
